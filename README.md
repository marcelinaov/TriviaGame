# TriviaGame

Created a Trivia game using JQuery to manipulate the HTML file and Javascript fo the logic. I also added the google font link as part of style. 7 questions generated with countdown timer for answer. App gives correct answer after user guess. After the 7 questions, app will display score with the option to play again.
